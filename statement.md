CGPA Calculator
Problem Statement:
The problem is the inefficiency and error risk of manually calculating SGPA/CGPA due to complex grading systems; the goal is to build a robust Python program for accurate, instantaneous computation of these weighted averages.

Scope Of the project:
The project scope is limited to building a standalone Python Command Line Interface (CLI) application focused entirely on accurate calculation.
Inclusions: Core calculation of SGPA/CGPA, Grade Mapping, input validation, and generating a CLI report.
Exclusions: No GUI, no database integration, no external data import, and no web/mobile support.

Target Users:
The target users are primarily Students (UG/PG) needing to track academic performance (SGPA/CGPA) and Educators/Advisors needing a simple tool for quick grade verification. The project is also useful for Beginner Programmers learning core Python concepts.

High-level features:
The Python CGPA calculator's core features are:
Accurate Calculation Engine: Computes SGPA/CGPA using the decimal module for guaranteed accuracy.
Configurable Grade Mapping: Uses a dictionary for instant, flexible conversion of grades to Grade Points (GP).
Robust Input/Output: Features immediate input validation and generates a clear CLI report.
